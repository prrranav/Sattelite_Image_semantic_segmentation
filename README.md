# Semantic segmentation using sattelite imagery

Semantic Segmentation on Satellite Imagery with Masked Images and RGB Images

## Description

This project aims to perform semantic segmentation on satellite imagery using a U-Net model. The goal is to classify the masked images and RGB images, segmenting them into distinct classes or regions of interest. The U-Net architecture has been implemented to achieve accurate and efficient segmentation results.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`

## Usage

After the installation, you can use the project as follows:

1. Prepare your dataset by organizing the masked images and RGB images in the appropriate directory structure.
2. Run the preprocessing scripts, if any, to preprocess the dataset.
3. Adjust the hyperparameters and settings in the configuration file to match your requirements.
4. Train the U-Net model on the prepared dataset using the provided training script.
5. Evaluate the trained model on test data and generate segmentation results.
6. Analyze and visualize the results as needed.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15jFiofxVm-Qc1lTgFWk_vpejD9ju_HH2?usp=sharing). It includes masked images and corresponding RGB images for semantic segmentation. Please download the dataset and organize it in the appropriate directory structure before running the project.

## Training

Explain the training process and any additional steps required before training. Provide instructions on how to run the training script and specify any optional parameters that can be configured.

## Results

Describe the results obtained from the trained model. Include metrics, visualizations, and any other relevant information to showcase the performance of the model. If applicable, provide instructions on how to reproduce the results or access pre-trained models.
